# Automated-Hangman
This is an automated version of hangman that uses a predefined word list. The way you play is that you guess a character and the computer tells you if the letter you entered is correct or not. There are just 5 chances to guess the word correctly from, after that you lose.

# Instructions on how to play
NOTE: Before you proceed to do the following steps, you have to install python 3 from the direct link and install it:

1. Extract the repository files to anywhere you prefer, but save the path of the "hangman.py" file. 
2. Launch your command prompt.
3. Navigate to the path where you pasted the "hangman.py" and the "wordz_for_hangman.txt" through your command prompt
4. And launch the game by typing (without the quotations)
